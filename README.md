Celtec Tecnologia - Guidelines
==============================

This repository was created to document our guidelines and styleguide of our app and stack.

As [Hugo Giraudel](http://hugogiraudel.com/) states in [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#introduction):

> A styleguide is not just a pleasing document to read, picturing an ideal state for your code. It is a key document in a project’s life, describing how and why code should be written. It may look like overkill for small projects, but it helps a lot in keeping the codebase clean, scalable and easily maintainable.
>
> Needless to say, the more developers involved on a project, the more code guidelines are needed. Along the same lines, the bigger the project, the more a styleguide is a must.

And Harry Roberts from [CSS Guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/#the-importance-of-a-styleguide):

> A coding styleguide (note, not a visual styleguide) is a valuable tool for teams who:
> * build and maintain products for a reasonable length of time;
> * have developers of differing abilities and specialisms;
> * have a number of different developers working on a product at any given time;
> * on-board new staff regularly;
> * have a number of codebases that developers dip in and out of.
